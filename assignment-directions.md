1. Declare ng-app either on the html or the body element. Name your app MenuApp.

2. You must follow the 1 artifact per file rule. That means if the JS file declares a controller, it should not declare anything else like a service or component and vice versa. Use a separate JS file to declare other artifacts in your application. Don't forget to include each JS file in your index.html!

3. Create a file called menuapp.module.js and declare an Angular module to match your ng-app declaration.

4. Create data.module.js file and declare another module in it called data. Make sure the MenuApp module lists the data module as a dependency.

5. Create menudata.service.js file and create a service called MenuDataService in it. This service should be declared on the data module, not on the MenuApp module. The MenuDataService should have 2 methods:
    getAllCategories - this method should return a promise which is a result of using the $http service, using the following REST API endpoint: https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com/categories.json
    getItemsForCategory(categoryShortName) - this method should return a promise which is a result of using the $http service, using the following REST API endpoint: https://davids-restaurant.herokuapp.com/menu_items.json?category=, where, before the call to the server, your code should append whatever categoryShortName value was passed in as an argument into the getItemsForCategory method.


6. Create categories.component.js file and create component called categories that shows all available categories in the menu to the user.


7. Create items.component.js file and create a component called items that shows all of the menu items for a particular category.


8. The categories and the items components should NOT directly use the MenuDataService to fetch their own data. Instead, the proper data should be simply passed into the component. (Hint: use the one-way < binding).


9. Create routes.js file and configure your routes and view states in it. These routes should be defined in the MenuApp module.

                                                                    HINTS
                                                                    
Hint: don't try to define the states all at once. Define one state, including whatever it needs and make sure it works all the way to the point when you can see the results on the screen. Then, move on to the next view state. That does mean that you will have to leave routes.js and define all the other artifacts listed below and then come back to it, etc.


Hint: The home state will not need a controller. Just a template.


Hint: The categories state can have a controller as well as a resolve. The resolve will use the MenuDataService to retrieve categories and inject them into the controller. The controller can then expose the retrieved categories object such that it can be simply passed into the categories component.


Hint: The items state can have the same type of setup as the categories state.
